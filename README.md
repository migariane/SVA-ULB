### Short Introduction to Survival (time-to-event) Analyses in Epidemiology and Public Health.  
Time-to-event data appears in many research areas such as medicine, epidemiology, engineering, biology, and finance, to name but a few. For instance, modeling and understanding the survival times of cancer patients has become an important aim of many countries. In statistical terms, times-to-event correspond to a sample of positive observations, possibly censored due to lost of follow-up or administrative censoring. These observations represent either the time at which the event of interest happens (e.g. death of a patient or failure of an electric device) or the last time of follow-up. There exist several approaches to model time to event data, such as nonparametric, semi-parametric, and parametric methods.
